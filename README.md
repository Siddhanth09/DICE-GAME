# DICE-Game

The game design focused on "Double Player Mode", which simulates the real-life dice game. The movement of the dice was controlled by pressing the push buttons of FPGA. The difficulty level of the game was increased by adding the extra features, which includes the speed control of the dice and the size control. The judgment of victory and defeat was done by comparing the accumulated points of the players. The game will restart again if the player inputs the RESET key.

At the end of the project, the compilation of the game design is found to be successful. The game can be displayed and functioned smoothly without any delay. Thus, this project is considered successful as the objectives were achieved.
